Australia’s limited overs captain Aaron Finch feels he doesn’t need a Big Bash League (BBL) triumph to get pumped up ahead of their tour to India. He further stated the challenge of going on tour was big enough and gets bigger with it involving a journey to the Indian sub-continent.

Finch will lead Australia in the upcoming two T20Is and five ODIs in India starting February 24 in preparation for the ICC World Cup that gets underway end of May. Finch’s BBL side Melbourne Renegades beat Melbourne Stars by 13 runs in the final on Sunday.
